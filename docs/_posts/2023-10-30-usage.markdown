This is the `Usage` page of the glados documentation.

Once you have your `glados` binary, you can use it with different flags for different usage:

./glados `MODE` input_file [-o output_file] -\- [args]

`Modes`:

- -\-compile:    compiles the file to byte code

- -\-exec:       executes a bytecode program

- -\-human:      compiles and prints the list of instructions

- -\-decode:     reads bytecode and prints the list of instructions

- -\-lisp:       uses a lisp interpreter

- -\-run:        executes a source code program


`input_file`:

 you can pass 'stdin' as the input file


`output_file`:

 you can pass 'stdout' as the output file

`args`:

 arguments for the program to be executed
