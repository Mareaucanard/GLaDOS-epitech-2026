This is the `Usage` page of the glados documentation.

Once you have your `glados` binary, you can use it with different flags for different usage:

./glados `MODE` input_file [-o output_file]"

`Modes`:

- --compile:    compiles the file to byte code

- --exec:       executes a bytecode program

- --human:      compiles and prints the list of instructions

- --decode:     reads bytecode and prints the list of instructions

- --lisp:       uses a lisp interpreter


`input_file`:

 you can pass 'stdin' as the input file


`output_file`:

 you can pass 'stdout' as the output file
