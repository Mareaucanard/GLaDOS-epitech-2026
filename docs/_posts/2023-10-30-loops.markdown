In the GLaDOS language, you can express a loop in the following way:
{% highlight BackusNaur %}
<while> ::= 'while' (<expression>) { <statement> }
{% endhighlight %}
The `while` keyword is followed by an expression, which is then followed by a block of statements. The block of statements is executed while the expression evaluates to `True`. If the expression evaluates to `False`, the block of statements is skipped.

You can also express a loop with the `for` keyword:
{% highlight BackusNaur %}
<for> ::= 'for' (<range>) { <statement> }
{% endhighlight %}
The `for` keyword is followed by a range, which is then followed by a block of statements. The block of statements is executed for each value in the range.
