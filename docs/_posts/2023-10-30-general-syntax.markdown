### In this part of the documentation, we will go through the general syntax of the GLaDOS language. This includes the following:
- Types
- Logical operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Comments

#### You will notice that our implementation of the GLaDOS language looks quite similar to the C programming language. Our language borrows part of the C programming language separators, keywords, etc... There is still some elements of it that display a clear difference to the C programming language, like the fact that variables are not typed, or that a lot of C's standard library are builtin functions in GLaDOS.
