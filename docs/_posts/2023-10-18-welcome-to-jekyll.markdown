This is a test `post`.
I will not be using posts as actual posts but rather a way to write documentation for the project regardless of time/date/etc...

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP` is consequently quite a stupid naming system considering I dont really care about the date of the documentation.

This is a jekyll snippet that i am keeping for reference:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
